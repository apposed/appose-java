'''
Appose is a library for interprocess cooperation with shared memory.
The guiding principles are *simplicity* and *efficiency*.

Appose was written to enable **easy execution of Python-based deep learning
from Java without copying tensors**, but its utility extends beyond that.
The steps for using Appose are:

* Build an *environment* with the dependencies you need.
* Create a *service* linked to a *worker*, which runs in its own process.
* Execute scripts on the worker by launching *tasks*.
* Receive status updates from the task asynchronously via callbacks.

## Examples

* TODO - move the below code somewhere linkable, for succinctness here.

Here is a very simple example written in Python:

    import appose
    env = appose.java(vendor="zulu", version="17").build()
    groovy = env.groovy()
    Task task = groovy.task("""
        5 + 6
    """)
    task.waitFor()
    result = task.outputs.get("result")
    assert 11 == result

And here is an example using a few more of Appose's features:

    import appose
    from time import sleep

    env = appose.java(vendor="zulu", version="17").build()
    groovy = env.groovy()
    task = groovy.task("""
        // Approximate the golden ratio using the Fibonacci sequence.
        previous = 0
        current = 1
        for (i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
            if (task.cancelRequested) {
                task.cancel()
                break
            }
            task.status(null, i, iterations)
            v = current
            current += previous
            previous = v
        }
        task.outputs["numer"] = current
        task.outputs["denom"] = previous
    """)

    def task_listener(event):
        match event.responseType:
            case UPDATE:
                print(f"Progress {task.current}/{task.maximum}")
            case COMPLETION:
                numer = task.outputs["numer"]
                denom = task.outputs["denom"]
                ratio = numer / denom
                print(f"Task complete. Result: {numer}/{denom} =~ {ratio}");
            case CANCELATION:
                print("Task canceled")
            case FAILURE:
                print(f"Task failed: {task.error}")

    task.listen(task_listener)

    task.start()
    sleep(1)
    if not task.status.isFinished():
        # Task is taking too long; request a cancelation.
        task.cancel()

    task.waitFor()

Of course, the above examples could have been done all in Python. But
hopefully they hint at the possibilities of easy cross-language integration.

## Workers

A *worker* is a separate process created by Appose to do asynchronous
computation on behalf of the calling process. The calling process interacts
with a worker via its associated *service*.

Appose comes with built-in support for two worker implementations:
`python_worker` to run Python scripts, and `GroovyWorker` to run Groovy
scripts. These workers can be created easily by invoking the environment
object's `python()` and `groovy()` methods respectively.

But Appose is compatible with any program that abides by the
*Appose worker process contract*:

1. The worker must accept requests in Appose's request format on its
   standard input (stdin) stream.
2. The worker must issue responses in Appose's response format on its
   standard output (stdout) stream.

TODO - write up the request and response formats in detail here!
JSON, one line per request/response.
