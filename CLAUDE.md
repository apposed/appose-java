# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Appose is a Java library for interprocess cooperation with shared memory. It enables easy execution of Python-based deep learning from Java without copying tensors, though its utility extends beyond that use case.

**Key concepts:**
- **Builder**: Type-safe classes for creating environments (`PixiBuilder`, `MambaBuilder`, `UvBuilder`, `SimpleBuilder`, `DynamicBuilder`)
- **Environment**: A configured environment with executables and dependencies (created by builders)
- **Service**: Provides access to a worker process running in a separate process
- **Task**: Asynchronous operation performed by a service (analogous to a Future)
- **Worker**: Separate process that executes scripts (Python via `python_worker`, Groovy via `GroovyWorker`)

Communication between service and worker happens via JSON over stdin/stdout. Workers must conform to the Appose worker process contract (see javadoc in `Appose.java`).

## Build Commands

```

## Architecture

### Core API Flow
1. **Builder** → `Environment`: Use `Appose.{pixi|mamba|file|custom|wrap}()...build()` to construct environments
2. **Environment** → `Service`: Call `env.python()`, `env.groovy()`, or `env.service()` to launch worker processes
3. **Service** → `Task`: Create tasks with `service.task(script)` to execute code asynchronously
4. **Task** → Results: Tasks provide status updates via `listen()` callbacks and outputs via `outputs` map

### Directory Structure

  - Factory methods provided by `Shms` utility class
  - Implementations discovered via `ShmFactory` ServiceLoader

### Plugin Architecture

The project uses Java's ServiceLoader mechanism for extensibility, with utility classes managing discovery:

- **Plugins** (`org.apposed.appose.util.Plugins`) - Core ServiceLoader abstraction
  - `discover()` - Load and optionally sort all implementations of an interface
  - `find()` - Find first implementation matching a predicate
  - `create()` - Try factories until one produces a result
  - Used by all other plugin utilities for consistent discovery patterns

- **Builders** (`org.apposed.appose.builder.Builders`) - Builder discovery and management
  - `findFactoryByName(name)` - Find builder by name (e.g., "pixi", "mamba")
  - `findFactoryByScheme(scheme)` - Find builder supporting a scheme (e.g., "pixi-toml", "conda")
  - `findFactoryBySource(source)` - Auto-detect builder from file path
  - `findFactoryForWrapping(envDir)` - Detect builder for existing environment
  - Factories cached and sorted by priority

- **Schemes** (`org.apposed.appose.util.Schemes`) - Configuration file format detection
  - `fromFilename(filename)` - Detect scheme from filename (e.g., "pixi.toml" → PixiTomlScheme)
  - `fromContent(content)` - Detect scheme from file contents
  - `fromName(name)` - Get scheme by name (e.g., "pixi-toml")
  - Schemes sorted by priority for correct detection order

- **Shms** (`org.apposed.appose.shm.Shms`) - Shared memory utilities and factory
  - `create(name, create, rsize)` - Create platform-appropriate shared memory
  - Platform-specific utilities for shared memory implementations

### Environment Building
Builders are type-safe and builder-specific:
- Each builder (`PixiBuilder`, `MambaBuilder`, etc.) handles its own configuration
- Builders implement `build(File envDir)` to create environments at specific locations
- Default environment location: `~/.local/share/appose/<env-name>`
- Builders can wrap existing environments or create new ones

### Worker Communication
- **Request types**: EXECUTE (run script), CANCEL (stop execution)
- **Response types**: LAUNCH, UPDATE, COMPLETION, CANCELATION, FAILURE, CRASH
- Each task has a UUID for tracking across processes
- Service monitors three streams: stdin (requests), stdout (responses), stderr (errors)

## Testing Requirements

Tests require:
- Java 8+ (project targets Java 8 compatibility)
- Python 3.10+ with `appose` package installed (`pip install appose`)
- System Python accessible on PATH

Some tests (like `testConda`) build conda environments and may take time on first run. Environments are cached in `~/.local/share/appose`.

## Main API Entry Points

The `Appose` class provides static factory methods for creating environments:

**Type-safe builders:**
- `Appose.pixi()` / `Appose.pixi(source)` - Creates a PixiBuilder
- `Appose.mamba()` / `Appose.mamba(source)` - Creates a MambaBuilder
- `Appose.uv()` / `Appose.uv(source)` - Creates a UvBuilder

**Dynamic builder:**
- `Appose.file(source)` - Creates a DynamicBuilder that auto-detects builder based on file extension

**Direct environment creation:**
- `Appose.system()` - Creates a SimpleBuilder with system PATH and inherited Java
- `Appose.wrap(directory)` - Wraps an existing environment directory, auto-detecting its type

## Important Notes

- **Dependencies in pom.xml must stay in sync** with the classpath construction in `Environment.java:130-138`
- When adding Appose dependencies, update both locations
- The project uses scijava-pom-parent, which provides standard Maven lifecycle configuration
- Shared memory implementations are platform-specific; changes should be tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Worker scripts must be single expressions for task results, or must populate `task.outputs["result"]` explicitly
- Builder classes are type-safe and builder-specific (no generic `include()` / `channel()` methods on base `Builder` interface)
- The plugin architecture uses ServiceLoader for extensibility, with discovery managed by utility classes (`Plugins`, `Builders`, `Schemes`, `Shms`)

## Builders

The project provides type-safe builder classes for different environment types:

### Implemented Builders

**PixiBuilder** - Modern package manager supporting both conda and PyPI
- Created via `Appose.pixi()` or `Appose.pixi(source)`
- Type-safe methods: `conda(packages...)`, `pypi(packages...)`, `channels(channels...)`
- Supports `pixi.toml` and `environment.yml` files
- Uses `pixi run --manifest-path <envDir>/pixi.toml` for activation
- Environment structure: `<envDir>/.pixi/envs/default`
- Location: `org.apposed.appose.builder.PixiBuilder`

**MambaBuilder** - Traditional conda environments via micromamba
- Created via `Appose.mamba()` or `Appose.mamba(source)`
- Supports `environment.yml` files
- Uses `mamba run -p <envDir>` for activation
- Location: `org.apposed.appose.builder.MambaBuilder`

**UvBuilder** - Fast Python virtual environments via UV
- Created via `Appose.uv()` or `Appose.uv(source)`
- Type-safe methods: `include(packages...)`, `python(version)`
- Supports `requirements.txt` files
- Standard Python venv structure (no special activation needed)
- Environment structure: `<envDir>/bin` (or `Scripts` on Windows)
- Location: `org.apposed.appose.builder.UvBuilder`

**DynamicBuilder** - Auto-detects appropriate builder based on source file
- Created via `Appose.file(source)`
- Methods: `scheme(scheme)`, `builder(builderName)`
- Delegates to PixiBuilder or MambaBuilder based on file extension or explicit scheme
- Uses ServiceLoader discovery with builder priorities
- Location: `org.apposed.appose.builder.DynamicBuilder`

**SimpleBuilder** - Uses an existing working directory without installing packages
- Created via `Appose.system()` or `Appose.custom().base("/path/to/cwd").build()`
- No package installation; uses whatever executables are on the system
- Method: `useSystemPath(boolean)` to control PATH inclusion
- Method: `inheritRunningJava()` to add running JVM's bin folder to binPaths
- Location: `org.apposed.appose.builder.SimpleBuilder`

### API Examples

```java
// Type-safe Pixi builder
Environment env = Appose.pixi("path/to/pixi.toml")
    .logDebug()
    .build();

// Type-safe Pixi builder with programmatic packages
Environment env = Appose.pixi()
    .conda("python>=3.8", "numpy")
    .pypi("cowsay")
    .channels("conda-forge")
    .build("my-env");

// Mamba builder
Environment env = Appose.mamba("path/to/environment.yml")
    .build();

// UV builder with requirements.txt
Environment env = Appose.uv("path/to/requirements.txt")
    .build();

// UV builder with programmatic packages
Environment env = Appose.uv()
    .python("3.11")
    .include("numpy", "pandas", "matplotlib")
    .build("my-env");

// Dynamic builder (auto-detects)
Environment env = Appose.file("path/to/environment.yml")
    .logDebug()
    .build();

// Wrap existing environment
Environment env = Appose.wrap("/path/to/existing/env");

// System environment
Environment env = Appose.system();
```

### Builder Discovery

Builders are discovered via `BuilderFactory` implementations managed by the `Builders` utility:
- Each factory implements `supportsScheme(scheme)` to declare supported file types and package schemes
- Each factory implements `canWrap(File)` to declare if it can wrap an existing environment directory
- Factories have priorities for conflict resolution when multiple support the same scheme
- `DynamicBuilder` uses `Builders.findFactoryBySource()` to automatically select the appropriate builder
- `Appose.wrap()` uses `Builders.findFactoryForWrapping()` to auto-detect environment type

### Environment Configuration
Builders create environments with three key properties:
- **launchArgs**: Args to prepend when launching workers (e.g., `["pixi", "run"]` for pixi)
- **binPaths**: Directories to search for executables
- **base**: The root directory of the environment

### Progress Monitoring
All builders support subscription methods for monitoring:
- `subscribeProgress(consumer)` - Progress updates with current/total steps
- `subscribeOutput(consumer)` - Standard output from build process
- `subscribeError(consumer)` - Error output from build process
- `logDebug()` - Convenience method that logs output and errors to stderr
